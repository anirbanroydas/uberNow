Method 2 - Machine Learning with predictive model
==================================================

This is still under consideration but yet to be implemented. Here we try to learn from the uber api calls and train on the dataset of the avaialble cabs at any particular time at any particular place and increase the accuracy of makeing uber api calls and this weiill allow us to not make uber api calls in intervals and  be more precise about when to make the uber api calls.

This method need access to uber api calls data and time to lear and train on the data and develop a better predictive model using it. Its not implemented yet. Happy to chat and discuss over this. I will work on this when I get time. This method needs more time and dedication. The first method is easy and thus I did it first and haven't got time around to implement the second method so far.
