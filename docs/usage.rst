Usage
=====

After having installed the above dependencies, and ran the **Optional** (If not using any CI Server) or **Required** (If using any CI Server) **CI Setup** Step, then just run the following commands to use it:


You can run and test the app in your local development machine or you can run and test directly in a remote machine. You can also run and test in a production environment. 


Run
----


The below commands will start everythin in development environment. To start in a production environment, suffix ``-prod`` to every **make** command.

For example, if the normal command is ``make start``, then for production environment, use ``make start-prod``. Do this modification to each command you want to run in production environment. 

**Exceptions:** You cannot use the above method for test commands, test commands are same for every environment. Also the  ``make system-prune`` command is standalone with no production specific variation (Remains same in all environments).
