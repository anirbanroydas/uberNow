The pubsub module provides interface for the rabbitmq client.

It provides classes to create pika clients to connect to rabbitmq broker server, interact with
and publish/subscribe to rabbitmq via creating channels, methods to publish, subscribe/consume, 
stop consuming, start publishing, start connection, stop connection, create channel, close channel, 
acknowledge delivery by publisher, acknowledge receiving of messages by consumers, send basic ack, 
basic cancel requests and also add callbacks for various other events.
